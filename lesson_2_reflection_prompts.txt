What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
    When a GitHub repo is initilized, a directory called ".git" is created 
    wherever the command git init was used. You need to do this because all
    of the information about the repository will be stored here from now on.
    All of the commands that run over GitHub will be using the metadata that is 
    stored on this file.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
    The git repository is already on the cloud, that means that all of your 
    project is being affected by the files that are here. The working directory
    is just stored locally, there is no connection at all to the internet. 
    The staging area contains the information that is going to be commited/ 
    the files that have been changed and that are being prepared to commit. This
    information is neither on the working directory nor on the repository 
    available and it is valuable becuase you can make sure that the files that 
    you are going to merge into the repo are the ones that you specifically 
    want.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
    When you have your files on the staging area, that means that it is neither 
    commited on the project nor is the same to the local directory where you 
    have cloned your git repository. You can checkout the changes or the 
    differences between the local directory and the staging area to make sure 
    that you only have added the files that represent one logical change.
